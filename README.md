# fun fun finances
Functions to help keep track of personal finances.

## Recomendations
* Use this to help keep track of your personal finances;
* Fork it and make it private, so you can have a nicely stored finance record;
* I strongly suggest using it inside Visual Studio Code, with the Quokka.js extension.
